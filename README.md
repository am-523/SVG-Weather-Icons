# SVG Weather Icons

This is mostly just a clone of __[Tempestacons](https://github.com/zagortenay333/Tempestacons)__, but with the SVG images named according to the icon codes in these popular weather APIs.

1. [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev)
2. [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
3. [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)
4. [Yahoo](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/) 


## Converting the icons to PNG

I wrote a handy __[conversion script](https://github.com/rickellis/SVG-to-PNG-via-Bash)__ in Bash to facilitate converting the SVG images to PNG in any size or color you wish.
